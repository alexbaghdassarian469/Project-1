The Armenian Student Association at California State University Northridge is more than a club. It provides a place on campus for Armenians to be unified. For some, it may even foster their first experience having Armenian friends. For others, it may be the a place where Armenians can be with other Armenians to share their culture. However, The Armenian Student Association does one thing better than anything else, it provides a place for responsible people of all ethnicities and backgrounds to learn about Armenian culture and have fun.

   <p class="mb-4 text-lg">To kick off the new Fall 2018 Semester, the board decided to do a welcome week similar to how a fraternity would have their rush week in order to provide members with a variety of different events that they could go to so that if they couldn’t make it to one, there would still be a chance to go to another. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The week included a kickoff event at the University Student Union’s very own Games Room where Armenians could get together and play several different types of recreational games together. Food and refreshments were also provided. The event was a success and attracted mostly the younger members of the club.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The second event that they had in the welcome week was the Hookah night at the Poseidon Hookah lounge very close to campus. Hookah is a staple in the middle eastern community similar to how Americans may go to a bar with a friend and get a drink when they want to talk. So instead of grabbing a drink, middle eastern people including armenians may have a chat while smoking Hookah.The event also was a success because it attracted the older members of the club.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The last event of the welcome week was the dinner night, which ended up being a huge success because it attracted the younger and older members. Overall, the welcome week was a success which proved to the members that events are going to be fun, and will also be heavily populated by members in order for members to meet as many different people as they can. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">There are several fun events in the works for the rest of the semester including the Cultural Fest, Halloween Horror Nights Day, and Halloween Party as well. The Cultural Fest will be a combination of different aspects of Armenian culture, such as authentic Armenian barbecue, Armenian musicians, artwork by different Armenians, and there will be some performances by our very own members as well. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The Halloween Horror Nights Day will be a fun gathering of people in the Armenian Student Association where we will go to Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights and experience the fun mazes together, which will hopefully spawn even more friendships among club members. The last event in October will be a Halloween party which will feature a DJ and will be a costume party as well, it is sure to be a lot of fun. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> Overall, CSUN ASA is doing a great job unifying it’s members and will hopefully continue to be the unifier among Armenians that it always has been.
