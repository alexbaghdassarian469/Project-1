  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">To kick off the 2018 fall semester the CSUN ASA decided to hold four general body meetings to introduce the new events that are to happen throughout the semester as well as to introduce the members to the new board members who will be hosting the events. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Every meeting was filled to maximum capacity as Armenians with many different kinds of backgrounds talked to each other and made new friends. The general body meetings at the beginning of the semester appeal to many of the underclassmen because most of them signed up at CSUN’s Meet The Clubs event. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Most of the meetings were conducted in the same format. During the first meeting, which was held in the Altadena room in the USU building next to the Subway on campus, I arrived to the room first in order to set up my camera gear because I am on the board this year as the cinematography director so it’s my job to take videos and pictures of the different events.</p>

<div alt="girl putting up Armenian flag" class="bg-quote2 container flex items-center justify-center h-screen mx-auto">
  <blockquote class="bg-white font-serif mx-4 p-4 text-center text-black md:p-8">
    <p class="font-bold italic text-3xl">
      &ldquo; I've always wanted Armenian friends, but I've never known where to find them.&rdquo;
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg text-white">
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">When I got to the room, I set up my gear and had the employee open the door and greeted the several members who were outside. As I motioned for them to come in the other board members arrived, including Mary, the president, Lia, the Vice President, Agavni, the social media coordinator, and Marine, the events coordinator. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> They all arrived and started setting up the powerpoint so that they could present to the members. However, the last board member to arrive was Raffi, the Treasurer. This was due to the fact that he had went to buy a case of water bottles for the club meeting. At this time, there were still only about five to seven members in the room and it was ten minutes before the meeting was supposed to start.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">I was then called by Raffi to come to the parking lot to help him take in some of the water bottles. I brought in the water bottles and was surprised to see the whole room filled to capacity, with something like 50 and more members. They then started the meeting by having the officers or board members of the club introduce themselves. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Then they talked about the different things that they have planned for the semester as well as membership dues for the members. Mary also showed a video of the famous DJ Khaled talk about Armenians. The video was taken by our treasurer, Raffi, so it was interesting to see.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Then, I spoke to the members about my idea for a documentary. I told them about how if any of their grandparents had stories of the Armenian genocide and that I would be happy to interview them and string them all together to form a unique documentary outline the experience that certain people had during the genocide</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Everyone was on board with it, and some people came up to me after the meeting to express their interest. Then, the Armenian fraternity and sorority went up to speak about their programs. And lastly, everyone was instructed to do an ice breaker with each other and before we even knew it, the entire room was talking to each other. It felt as though people were making friends with each other.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> Overall, the first general body meetings were a complete success which captivated the members enough for them to be excited to be apart of the club.
