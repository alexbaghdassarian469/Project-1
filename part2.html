  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">CSUN ASA decided to host a dinner night where members could get together and have a fun time eating authentic Armenian food, while meeting new people and making new friends. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The Vice President of the club, Lia, offered her home for the event. She along with her family set up the party to take place outside. They had a large open backyard where they had set up several chairs and tables. They also had a gazebo where it looked like hours were spent decorating it with the colors of the Armenian flag, as well as having a large Armenian flag hanging on the wall that the gazebo was parallel to. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The gazebo also had wires with light bulbs on them which spanned the length of the large backyard and connected back to the patio of the house. The wires were also decorated with the colors of the Armenian flag so all in all, the backyard looked incredible, and set a nice warm, Armenian ambiance for the dinner night. As people started to arrive, they joined the other members by sitting inside the gazebo. It was nice because it seemed like there were no cliques where people were afraid to approach other people for a conversation.</p>

      &ldquo;The most fun I've had in a long time.&rdquo;

<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg text-white">
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> Everyone was welcoming and seemed to be having a great time. Later, someone brought out a bluetooth speaker and started playing Armenian music, which was nice. Then, almost an hour into the event, something like 20 people showed up and filled the backyard. It was amazing to see such a large turnout for an event like the dinner night. I tried to take as many videos as possible. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">I also went around and introduced myself to every party of people that were at the event and asked if they wanted their picture taken. Most of them wanted their pictures taken. Then, the other board members brought out the food and everyone slowly got up to dig in. It was great seeing our members eating and talking to each other.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> After they finished eating, the board members organized for everyone to take a group picture, which turned out to be a great picture that a lot of the members will probably remember for years to come. </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Overall, I think the event was a success and many of our members made and found friends there.</p>
